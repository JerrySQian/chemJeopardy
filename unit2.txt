How many neutrons are there in an atom of Phosphorus with mass number 32?
15
16
17
18
3
We know that the number of neutrons is the mass number - the atomic number (number of protons). Since Phosphorus has an atomic number of 15, the answer is 32 - 15 = 17.
In Ernest Rutherford’s famous gold foil experiment, which of the following conclusions was made?
Electrons exist.
The Atom is very small.
The Atom is made up of mostly empty space.
The Atom has a negative core.
3
In this experiment, alpha particles were sent through extremely thin gold foil. What Rutherford observed was that most of the particles passed through without interruption. The fact that most of the particles just passed through the gold signified to Rutherford that most of the atom is empty space.
Which of the following is false about the atom?
Most of its mass comes from its nucleus.
Most if it is empty space.
The nucleus is positively charged.
Alpha particles will not pass through an atom.
4
The atom allows alpha particles to pass through it, as seen in the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment.
Which of the statements is false? Different isotopes of the same element have …
The same number of protons.
The same number of electrons
The same charge.
The same mass number.
4
Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons/electrons yet differ in the number of neutrons they have. Since mass number is the sum of the protons and the neutrons, the mass number of different isotopes of the same element will inevitably differ.
There are four species: H-1, H-2, He-3, He-4. Which of the following has the same number of neutrons?
H-1, He-4
H-1, He-3
H-2, He-3
H-2, He-4
3
The answer is H-2, He-3 due to the fact that both of these species have two neutrons. Note that the number of neutrons is the mass number - the number of protons. Thus, H-1 has 0 neutrons, H-2 has 1, He-2 has 1, and He-4 has 2 neutrons. 
How is the atomic mass of an element determined?
Twice the number of protons 
Twice the number of neutrons
Twice the number of electrons
The weighted average of naturally occurring isotopes
4
This is just a definition. :)
Which groups of elements make colorful ions in solution?
Alkali Metals
Halogens
Noble Gases
Transition Metals
4
Transition Metals are known to make colorful ions in solution, a notable example being copper.
Which scientist is given credit for creating the modern periodic table?
Mendeleev
Dalton
Rutherford
Thomson
1
Mendeleev was said to have discovered the periodic table when grouping the elements together by their properties. During this process, he actually hypothesized about the existence of a couple elements, which were later discovered separately.
Which scientist is known for his “Plum Pudding Model”?
Mendeleev
Dalton
Rutherford
Thomson
4
Thomson is known for his “Plum Pudding Model”. This model, which was “proven” with the Cathode Ray Experiment, concluded that the atom had small negative particles called electrons, which was surrounded by an overall positive space. In comparison to plum pudding, the raisins would be the electrons, and the pudding itself would be the positive cloud. 
What is a Magnesium ion’s nuclear charge?
+2
0
10
12
4
The answer is 12. The problem asks for the charge on the nucleus, not the charge on the overall ion.
Graphite and Diamond are used in completely different ways. Diamond is used as an industrial abrasive or as jewelry, yet graphite is most commonly seen as a lubricant or in our pencils. However, both of these are made out of carbon. What is the relationship between the two?
They are isotopes.
They are isomers.
They are allotropes.
They are friends.
3
Graphite and Diamond are allotropes. Allotropes are composed of the same elements, yet are structurally very different. This different physical structure gives them drastically different physical properties.
Let us say that the letter Z represents an element’s atomic number, letter A represents an element’s mass number, letter E represents the number of electrons, letter N represents the number of neutrons, and the letter C represents the charge. Then, which of the following is not necessarily true?
A - Z = N
C = Z - E
N + Z = A
A - E = N
4
The fourth statement is not necessarily true. If the element is an ion, then the statement doesn’t hold, as the number of electrons could vary drastically.
Which of the element lists contains an alkali metal, an transition metal, and a noble gas?
Sodium, Copper, Krypton
Sodium, Zinc, Copper
Magnesium, Hydrogen, Titanium
Potassium, Zinc, Sulfur
1
Sodium, Copper, and Krypton are the only three that satisfy these conditions.
In the periodic table, which of the following groups is the most metallic in character?
1
2
17
18
1
The answer is group 1, the alkali metals. Note that the closer we get to the left of the periodic table, the more metallic the groups are.
A sample of an element X has 90.9% with atomic mass 12.0 and 9.10% with atomic mass 14.0. Calculate the average atomic mass of this element.
12.2
1220
12
12.18

Our calculations are as follows. We multiply the percentages to their respective atomic masses and then add them together. Then, we divide by 100. To three significant figures, this should yield 12.2
