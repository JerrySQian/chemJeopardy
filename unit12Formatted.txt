This is a defining trait of a strong acid. Weak acids, when partially, dissociated, dissociate very little.'],

	['Which of the following is not an Arrhenius base?', 'LiOH', 'Mg(OH)2', 'KOH', 'NH3', '4', 'NH3 is not an Arrhenius base due to the fact that it does not have the hydroxide ion. Thus, while NH3 is basic, it is not an Arrhenius base.'],

	['Which of the following is not an electrolyte?', 'Salts', 'Acids', 'Bases', 'Hydrocarbons', '4', 'An electrolyte is defined as something that becomes ions in solution, conducting an electrical current. Acids, bases, and salts all have this ability. However, since hydrocarbons are molecular, they will not dissolve in solution.'],

If we let the left hand side be the side for acids and the right hand side the side for bases, we get the following equation. 100mL(0.500M) = 2(200mL)M. Solving for M, we get 0.125M.'],
