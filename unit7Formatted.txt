	['We have a balloon, which we’ll blow up with air. Afterwards, this balloon will be heated up in a hot water bath. Will this balloon shrink/swell in size, and does this show an inverse/direct relationship between temperature and volume?', 'Shrink, Inverse', 'Shrink, Direct', 'Swell, Inverse', 'Swell, Direct', '4', 'By Charles’ Law, we know that the relationship between temperature and volume is direct. If the balloon is heated up, the greater kinetic energy in the gas molecules will cause for the balloon to expand. Thus, the balloon will swell and this shows a direct relationship.'],
	['At standard pressure, I have some 224 liters of Hydrogen gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure. How many Hydrogen atoms will I have?', '5 moles', '10 moles', '20 moles', '100 moles', '3', 'To begin with, note that Hydrogen is a diatomic element. Then, we have the constant of 22.4 L/mol for all gases at STP. With some dimensional analysis, we determine that we have 10 moles of H2 gas. However, the problem asks not for the number of molecules but for the number of the H2 atoms, of which there are 2(10) = 20.'],

	['I put equal masses of Oxygen and Chlorine gas into a container. Assuming no reaction takes place, what is true about this system?', 'The Chlorine molecules have greater kinetic energy than the Oxygen molecules.', 'Since Chlorine molecules are larger, they will slowly react with the Oxygen molecules.', 'There are 22.4 moles of Oxygen and Chlorine respectively.', 'There is an unequal amount of chlorine and oxygen molecules.', '4', 'Since the molar masses of the two gases are different, there will inevitably be a different number of molecules.'],

For the pressure to increase, the temperature must increase. The relationship between pressure and temperature is direct. The only answer choice where the temperature increases is 303K.'],
	['Which gas has the greatest density at STP?', 'H2', 'O2', 'F2', 'Cl2', '4', 'Since the molar mass of Cl2 is the greatest, it will have the greatest density, as the volume of all of these gases at STP is simply 22.4 L/mol.'],

Isolate n and then input the correct numbers. Afterwards, find the molar mass of NH3 and then multiply n by the molar mass of NH3 to get a final answer. 12.3 should be the closest.'],

	['We have a series of 4 rooms. Each of the rooms is slightly larger than the one before it, and all of them are filled with the same gas. A chemistry student, Hector, claims that since gas expands to fit it’s container, each of the rooms will have identical moles of gas. His friend, Jonas, claims that by Avogadro’s Law, each of the rooms will have different moles of gas.

To begin with, we know that there are (6.00 L)(1 mole/22.4L) = 0.268 moles of butane. Then, the mole ratio from butane to water is 5, so (0.268 moles)(5) = 1.34.']
