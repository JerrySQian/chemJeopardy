During this process, the kinetic energy of the particles…', 'Increases', 'Decreases', 'Remains Constant', 'None of the answer choices is correct', '3', 'Note that the kinetic energy of the particles stays constant when this is happening. Instead, the potential energy of the particles slowly increases.'],
	['Which of the following statements is true?', 'The heat of vaporization is less than the heat of fusion.', 'The heat of vaporization is equal to the heat of fusion.', 'The heat of vaporization is greater than the heat of fusion.', 'The heat of vaporization is equal for all substances.', '3', 'The heat of vaporization is always greater than the heat of fusion due to the fact that it takes more energy to completely alter the positions of the molecules as seen in the process of vaporization. This is in contrast to fusion, where the molecules positions are disrupted significantly less.'],
	['Which of the following is an explanation for why some liquids require greater times to evaporate?', 'The darker color of a liquid causes longer evaporation times.', 'Some liquids are “heavier” with larger molecules, meaning it is more difficult for them to evaporate.', 'Some liquids have stronger intermolecular forces than others.', 'Some liquids have stronger intramolecular forces than others.', '3', 'The stronger intermolecular forces between some liquids cause for a longer evaporation time.'],
	['A certain substance has a high melting point, and conducts electricity in aqueous solution. Which type of solid is it?', 'Covalent Molecular', 'Covalent Network', 'Metallic', 'Ionic', '4', 'The answer is 4. Ionic substances have high melting points and dissolve into ions in aqueous solutions, allowing them to conduct electricity.'],
	['What type of bonding is present in diamond?', 'Ionic', 'Metallic', 'Hydrogen', 'Covalent', '4', 'Covalent bonding is clearly the answer, as diamond is made of carbon. Diamond, a covalent network solids, relies on the strength of its carbon bonds for its properties.'],
	['Utilize the Chemistry Reference Tables for this question. At 313K, propanone will boil at ', '47 kPa', '57 kPa', '67 kPa', '77 kPa', '2', 'Note that liquids boil when the vapor pressure is equal to the air pressure. Utilizing Table H, we find our answer of 57 kPa.'],
	['Based on your knowledge of chemistry, order CH4, CH4CH2OH, and CH3CH2CH3 in order of increasing viscosity. ', 'CH4, CH4CH2OH, CH3CH2CH3', 'CH4CH2OH, CH3CH2CH3, CH4', 'CH4, CH3CH2CH3, CH4CH2OH', 'All of them have the same viscosity.', '3', 'Viscosity is directly related to the strength of the intermolecular forces. CH4 and CH3CH2CH3 only have London Dispersion forces to hold them together but CH4CH2OH is held together with hydrogen bonding. CH3CH2CH3 has stronger intermolecular forces than CH4 due to the fact that it is a larger molecule. '],

	['A certain substance that is currently a solid is heated for an infinitely long time at a rate of 200 Joules per minute. It’s heat of fusion is 1200 joules per minute. How long will this substance “plateau” at its melting point?', '3 minutes', '4 minutes', '5 minutes', '6 minutes', '4', 'At this rate, it will take 1200/200 = 6 minutes.'],

How many Joules will it take to vaporize 2 moles of water?', '4520 Joules', '81360 Joules', '8136 Joules', '2260 Joules', '2', 'The answer is 81360 Joules. To begin with, we must figure out the molar mass of water, which happens to be 18.00 grams per mole. Thus, we have 36 grams of water. Then, 36(2260) = 81360 Joules.'],
	['Which of the following compounds has the lowest vapor pressure?', 'CH4', 'C2H6', 'C4H10', 'C5H12', '4', 'Vapor pressure is inversely related to IMF strength, which is directly related to molecule size. Thus, to find the compound with the lowest vapor pressure, we should be looking for the largest molecule, which happens to be C5H12.'],
	['Which of the following changes is endothermic?', 'Vaporization', 'Deposition', 'Condensation', 'Freezing', '1', 'The only one that requires heat is vaporization, which requires heat to change phases from liquid to gas.'],
	['What is the definition of an amorphous solid?', 'A solid with strong Intermolecular Forces.', 'A solid with weak Intermolecular Forces.', 'A solid with regular crystalline structure.', 'A solid with irregular structure.', '4', 'This is just a definition.'],
	['Butane (C4H10) has a heat of vaporization of 21.0 kJ/mole. How much heat would it take to evaporate 116 grams of Butane?', '21.0 kJ', '42.0 kJ', '84.0 kJ', '210. kJ', '2', 'The molar mass of butane is 58 grams per mole. This means that we have 2 moles of butane. Then, 2 moles(21.0kJ/mole) = 42.0 kJ, which is our second answer choice.'],
	['How much heat will it require to melt 100. grams of water at 273K and then proceed to heat it to 313K?', '40.1 kJ', '50.1 kJ', '60.1 kJ', '70.1 kJ', '2', 'We need to utilize two formulas here. The first is q = mass(Heat of Fusion). Utilizing the fact that the heat of fusion of water is 334 Joules/g means that our total heat will be 334(100) = 33.4 kJ. Then, we must utilize the second formula, or q = mass (specific heat of water) (change in temperature). Putting in our values, we have that q= 100. g (4.18J/(g times Kelvin) (40K). This ends up being around 16.7 kJ. 33.4 kJ + 16.7 = 50.1 kJ, which is our final answer.']
